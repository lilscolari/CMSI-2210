========================================================

TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 91.00/100.00 which is 91% which is an A-minus

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD.nasm
   perfect!

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c
   perfect, although you could have done a few more tests with some values
      that aren't quite so obvious...

problem 3 paritygen.nasm
   code compiles, links, and runs with no errors, but I don't see any output
      from the program run.  There should be a message telling the user what
      to do.  Also, I only get a zero on the output.  If I enter a "7" that
      is correct, but if I enter a "3" I would expect to see a one and I get
      a zero again.

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c
   perfect!

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c
   This has a problem.  makeNBOC.c compiles fine, but makeNBOtest.c has an
      error from the linker due to "multiple definition of `nbocConverter'"
      because you have done what I told you NOT to do several times in class:
      you included a "C" source code file.  Thus, you got the "multiple
      definition" error and your program won't link.  If it won't link, it
      won't run.
   I fixed the errors for you since they were trivial, so you can see how to
      actually do this.  It cost you, but now it links and runs.

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm
   This one compiles, links, and runs, but goes into an infinite loop.  Too
      bad on that one...

========================================================
SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~  98.84% of  5 points =  4.94 points
   homework04 ~  93.33% of  5 points =  4.67 points
   homework05 ~  98.00% of 10 points =  9.80 points
   homework06 ~  91.00% of 15 points = 13.65 points
                       semester total: 43.06 out of 45.00 = 95.69%
                             which is an A on the homework

Great work on this difficult assignment!  You were smart to use win32 in the
programs instead of trying to use win64...

It's been a great pleasure having you in class and I look forward to seeing
you in future classes.  Good luck on the final!
