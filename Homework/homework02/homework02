1. What is a computer system?
A computer system is a set of hardware and software that iteracts with itself and external inputs to process digital logic in order to produce an output.
2. What are some of the parts of a computer system?
Some of the parts of a computer system are the circuits, instruction architecture, motherboards, CPUs, executable programs, monitors, and more.
3. What is the difference between a compiled language and an intepreted language?
A compiled language is converted directly into machine code so that the machine can execute the instructions while an interpreted language is a language that executes instructions directly without initially compiling it into machine code.
4. Is C a compiled language?
C is a compiled language.
5. Who invented the C language?
Dennis Ritchie invented the C programming language.
6. How long has C been in use?
C first appeared in 1972 according to Ray Toal's notes, but it was developed during 1969-1973.
7. Is a compiler a translator?
A compiler translates code into assembly language.
8. Is an assembler a translator?
An assembler translates assembly language into machine language.
9. What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window?
The command is 'ls'.
10. What does the C function atof() do?
The C function atof() converts the C-string str to a value of type double by interpreting the string as a numerical value according to this article (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/atol-atoll-and-atof-functions-in-c-c/) on GeeksForGeeks.  
11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
The two bottom layers of a computer system are Digital logic and Control.  Digital logic is the circuitry and lowest level hardware that all operations run on. Control processes microcode (generally software) using the Digital logic.
12. What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
The three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture are:
1. Control Unit fetches an instruction from memory, and saves the location in the program counter.
2. The instruction is then decoded so that the microcode can understand the instruction. 
3. The arithmetic logic unit executes the instruction, and the cycle repeats.
13. What is the purpose of an ALU?
The ALU or Arithmetic Logic Unit is the part of the processor that performs operations done on integers, including math and bit-wise operations. The data for the ALU may come from the CPU or outisde the CPU. 
14. What is a register?
A register is a memory unit used for storing data within a computer's CPU.
15. What is one difference between Application software and System software?
One difference between application software and system software is that application software is written for humans while system software is written for computers.
16. Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?
No, these are examples of assembly language.
17. How many buses are included in the system bus?
There are three buses included in the system bus: the data bus, the address bus, and the control bus.
18. What is the decimal value of 10010111?
The decimal value of 10010111 is 151.
19. What is the decimal value of 11111111?
The decimal value of 11111111 is 255.
20. What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits?
The largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits is 1111111111111111 or 1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128+256+512+1024+2048+4096+8192+16384+32768=65535
